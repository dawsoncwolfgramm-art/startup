        Ever been stuck in awkward silence? My applicatoin gives you instant conversation starters, perfect for 
        parties, road trips, or just breaking the ice. In seconds, you’ll have everyone laughing, debating, 
        and connecting! It’s easy to use, fun for all ages, and makes talking to people way less stressful. 
        Whether you’re with friends or meeting someone new, you’ll always have something to say.

        HOW TO USE: 
        The way to play the game is to first choose a topic that interests you. Then after the game has 
        started, ChatGPT will be sent a question to put up in the prompt window. This will be where you 
        will read and vote on weather you agree with or disagree with the prompt. When pressed it will 
        show the percentage of how many people said yes or no and then there will be a chat underneath 
        to talk to people who also have voted why they would choose that choice. Anyone is invited and 
        we hope this gives people more than just generic questions about one another.
